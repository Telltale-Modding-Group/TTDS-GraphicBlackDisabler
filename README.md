# Graphic Black Disabler for S4

This is Graphic Black Disabler mod for S4 (The Walking Dead Telltale Definitive Edition)

NOW before you begin writing you might be asking yourself, "Dude, can't you disable graphic black through the options menu?". The answer is no, not for TWD S4. You can only disable it in all of the previous seasons (formerly S1, S2, S3, and Michonne) but not the final season.

This mod disables graphic black entirely in the final season. The comparisons can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWalkingDeadGame/comments/hk795l/mod_twd_season_4_graphic_black_disabler/) My biggest gripe about graphic black is how destructive it is with shadow detail, and not to mention how the additional LUT that is applied after the fact further limits the color palette of the final image (TFS also has an orange-green graduated filter that primarily gives a green hue to the image which I find undesirable). Disabling the graphic black allows the details in shadows to be preserved once again, while also removing those additional effects to make colors look by far more natural then they previously were.

I should note this currently only works for 'The Walking Dead Definitive Edition'.

This mod is compatible with the [Telltale Mod Launcher.](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/TelltaleModLauncher) and can be installed using the tool.
